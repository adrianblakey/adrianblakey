## Welcome to Adrian (Arseny) and Richard's Technologies

This is the home of the Remora slot car eComm, a brushless motor electronic commutator. The little electronic gizmo that you need to run a brushless motor in a slot car.

It'll also be the place where we'll list some other things we've been working on.

### The Remora

The best place to learn all about it is on the [github WiKi.](https://github.com/adrianblakey/slot-car-ecom/wiki)

### Purchasing One 

We sell the ***Remora1*** - the first version of the eCom - fully flashed with the latest version of the ESCape32 binary. This will work right out of the box. Solder on the lead and motor wires and off you go.

We also sell a ***WiFi Link*** - fully flashed with the latest formware. This allows you to set all the parameters of the eCom. This comes with a small cable to attach it to the Remora1 and a bent crocodile clip that you'll find useful for extracting the connector from the eCom.

### Pricing

Remora1 - US pricing $38, UK pricing £35   
WiFi - US pricing $15, UK pricing £12
