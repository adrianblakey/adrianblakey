# Welcome to Adrian (Arseny) and Richard's Technologies

This is the home of the Remora1 slot car eComm, a brushless electronic commutator. It's a little electronic gizmo that you need to run a brushless slot car motor.

It'll also be the place where we'll list some other things we've been working on.

If you've just got a Remora1 you might want to read the [Getting Started](https://github.com/adrianblakey/slot-car-ecom/wiki/Getting-Started).

## The Remora1

The is the world's best eCom. It beats the competition hands down by being the fastest, cheapest, most robust, and most flexible eCom you can buy. It can commutate all motors ranging in performance from 2,000Kv up to 22,000Kv+. The same board can do it all. If you are using a high Kv motors (say 10,000Kv and above) you might need to make a simple configuration change to increase the timing advance - but that's not hard because [there's plenty of help](https://github.com/adrianblakey/slot-car-ecom/wiki/Getting-Started).

Learn all about it is on the [github WiKi.](https://github.com/adrianblakey/slot-car-ecom/wiki)

### Purchasing One 

We sell:  

The ***Remora1*** - the first version of the eCom - fully flashed with the latest version of the ESCape32 binary. This will work right out of the box. Solder on the lead and motor wires and off you go.   

The ***WiFi Link*** - fully flashed with the latest firmware. This allows you to set all the parameters of an eCom. This comes with a small cable to attach it to the Remora1 and a bent crocodile clip that you'll find useful for extracting the connector from the eCom. You'll only ever need one of these.

  Your full name.

### The Process

We'll respond to you by email with an order number, quoting a price for the parts, plus shipping and the lead time. There is a chance that we might not have enough inventory to ship you the parts immediately, if so we'll tell you what we can do, either split the shipment or wait till we have them.

If you agree - then please reply affirming the order. If not tell us why you're rejecting the quote (e.g. cost, lead time etc.) we'd like to hear why you changed your mind so we can improve our service.

If you affirm the order, we'll send you an invoice request to pay using PayPal. We ask that you send the funds - "friends and family". If you are in the UK we are able to furnish bank transfer instructions if that's easier for you.

If you have any inquiries about anything, please [send us email](mailto:sales@aart.dev?subject=[Inquiry]) and just ask. We are happy to answer any questions. You might for example want to also give us a heads up when you might like to place an order in the future to help our planning.
